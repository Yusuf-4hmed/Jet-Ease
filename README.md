Big plans for this site in the future :)

Some things I am planning to add:
- [x] Travel time calculator (How long you trip will be..)
- [x] Time difference (difference between departing country and destination country)
- [ ] Gradual sleep shift routine chart / table
- [ ] Ability to save routine to calender or to device
