### How To Use:

- Please use REAL flights to get accurate information, if you do not have a flight you can test out some from here: <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhopEgoyMDI1LTA1LTExagwIAhIIL20vMDRqcGxyDQgCEgkvbS8wMl8yODYaKRIKMjAyNS0wNS0xOWoNCAISCS9tLzAyXzI4NnIMCAISCC9tLzA0anBsQAFIAXABggELCP___________wGYAQE&tfu=CmhDalJJWVhocWNteGlWVk4zVjJkQlJsbHhSbEZDUnkwdExTMHRMUzB0TFhkaVltUnBOa0ZCUVVGQlIyWlZkbE4zVDJWM1gxRkJFZ0l5TXhvTENJeUxBaEFDR2dOSFFsQTRLWERhMlFJPQ" target="_blank">Flights from Google</a>

Big plans for this site in the future :)

Some things I am planning to add:
- [x] Travel time calculator (How long you trip will be..)
- [ ] Gradual sleep shift routine algorithm
- [ ] Gradual sleep shift routine chart / table
- [ ] Ability to save routine to calender or to device
